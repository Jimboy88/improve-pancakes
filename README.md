# improve-pancakes
There’s no shame in boxed pancakes. These handy, pre-mixed packages are easy to whip together with just a few ingredients. In fact, you won’t find me on a camping trip without a Nalgene bottle full of purchased pancake mix, armed and ready to add water, shake, and pour for some easy campfire flapjacks. Boxed pancakes are convenient, but they rarely measure up to the flavor and texture of made-from-scratch pancakes. There’s no need to miss out on fluffy stacks if you’re already pulling out your griddle and spatula anyway. These simple boxed pancake mix hacks are simple and will make your pancakes from a mix taste even better.
